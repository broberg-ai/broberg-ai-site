# broberg-ai-site — cardmem-managed

This repo is managed via [cardmem](https://cardmem.com). The canonical
CLAUDE.md sections (`## Project layout`, `## Working with cardmem`),
`.mcp.json`, `.claude/skills/`, and hooks are installed by the cardmem
daemon scaffold on first local clone — this stub is just the seed so the
repo is non-empty at creation. Run the daemon scaffold (or re-audit in
cardmem Settings) to complete setup.

## Project layout

> **Fill this in for THIS repo.** Every cardmem-compatible repo MUST have a `## Project layout` section with the columns `Area | Path | Notes`. The cardmem Init flow (or the `feature` skill) populates it from the repo's actual structure — replace the example rows below.

| Area | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| _(example — replace)_ App | `src/` | Main application code |
| _(example — replace)_ Tests | `tests/` | Test suites |

Replace the example rows above with this repo's real layout before relying on cardmem skills to scope changes.


## Working with cardmem

> **Canonical section per F057 multi-project convention.** Every cardmem-compatible repo gets this same block, copied verbatim (the URLs and F-number rules are universal). The `## Project layout` table above is what differs per repo.

- **MCP endpoint.** This repo declares the cardmem MCP server in `.mcp.json`. cc sessions in this repo get the full `cardmem_*` tool surface (search, list, create, write_plan, pickup, handoff, …).
- **F-numbers + plan-docs.** Every feature has a number (`F<n>`, with sub-stories `F<n>.<m>`, tasks `F<n>.<m>.<k>`). The plan-doc lives at `docs/features/F<n>-<slug>.md` and MUST be written in the same commit/turn as the card. Never "I'll write the plan next" — see the UFRAVIGELIG rule below.
- **Boards.** Each project has at least one board with the default columns: Backlog → Ready → In progress → Review → Done. The board renders from the `cards` table — there is no separate `FEATURES.md` mirror.
- **The `feature` skill** (`.claude/skills/feature.md`) is the canonical entry point for proposing new work. It checks for duplicates via `cardmem_search`, assigns the next F-number via `cardmem_suggest_next_f_number`, reads the `## Project layout` table above to scope the plan, writes the plan-doc via `cardmem_write_plan`, and creates the cards via `cardmem_create_card` / `cardmem_create_cards`.
- **Queue-drain.** When this session opts into queue-drain (`cardmem_session_start({ auto_pickup_mode: 'queue-drain' })`), Ready cards are picked up automatically without asking. See `.claude/skills/queue-drain.md`.
- **Handoff back to review** via `cardmem_handoff_card` once a card's AC is met. The PostToolUse hook injects the next Ready card as a binding pickup directive.
- **Interactive UI ⇒ data-testid (HARD RULE, F086).** If a card builds or changes ANY interactive UI element (button, input, select, checkbox, link, custom control, anything with onClick/onChange), you MUST add a semantic, kebab-case `data-testid` to every such element before handoff — that is the stable anchor Lens drives + verifies (a missing anchor means Lens can't click or assert it). Self-check before handoff: the cardmem daemon's `POST 127.0.0.1:7475/lens/testid-gaps {"local_path":"<repo>"}` must report no NEW interactive gaps from your change. No exceptions.
- **Browser automation ⇒ Cardmem Lens, never raw Playwright (HARD RULE, F112).** Any time you need to drive, screenshot, verify, or E2E-test a browser/UI, you MUST use **Cardmem Lens** (the `cardmem-lens` MCP, or the daemon at `127.0.0.1:7475`) — never a raw `playwright` / `puppeteer` / `chromium` script. The daemon owns the browser, so **anything you could script locally with Playwright, Lens can do by proxy.** If Lens genuinely cannot do what you need 100%, do NOT work around it with a one-off script — **file a Lens capability request** (`cardmem_capture_idea` tagged `lens-gap`, or ask the cardmem session via intercom) so it gets built INTO Lens, then use it. Reaching for raw Playwright is a contract violation; the missing-capability escalation is the correct path. See `.claude/skills/lens.md`. No exceptions.
- **Design proposals ⇒ Cardmem Mockups, never ad-hoc HTML (HARD RULE, F122).** Any visual design proposal / mockup ("mock it up", "vis mig hvordan det ser ud", "lav en mockup") MUST be created with **`cardmem_save_mockup`** (the `.claude/skills/mockup.md` skill) so it lands in the **Mockups** surface — self-contained HTML, cross-linked to its source card/idea, versioned + status-tracked, viewable in-app (image OR interactive). **Never** drop a one-off `.html` file in the repo, a loose screenshot, or an inline artifact and call it "the mockup" — it goes stale + invisible. For a large/generated mockup, commit the file and pass **`html_url`** (a public raw URL) so the server fetches it — the HTML never shuttles through your context (token-frugal + drift-proof). If the mockup tool genuinely can't express what you need, file a gap (`cardmem_capture_idea` tagged `mockup-gap`, or ask the cardmem session) instead of working around it. No exceptions.


## Behavioral guidelines

> **Canonical section per F057 multi-project convention.** Same block ships into every cardmem-compatible repo. Reduces common LLM coding mistakes; merge with project-specific instructions as needed.
>
> Tradeoff: these guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

### Rule 1 — Think before coding

Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.

Before implementing:

- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### Rule 2 — Simplicity first

Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

### Rule 3 — Surgical changes

Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.

When editing existing code:

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it.

The test: every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### Rule 4 — Goal-driven execution

Define success criteria. Loop until verified.

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass."
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass."
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after."

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.


## Scheduled dispatch — buddy as "cron-as-a-service" (F062)

Any repo/session can register a **recurring job** with the always-on buddy
daemon instead of hand-rolling its own poll-loop. This is the fleet-wide
canonical setup — copy this section into every repo's CLAUDE.md.

**Tools** (`mcp__buddy__*`): `schedule_job`, `list_jobs`, `cancel_job`,
`pause_all`.

- **`schedule_job`** — register a recurring dispatch. Two kinds:
  - `interval` — every N seconds (min 60) send `command` to `targetSession`.
  - `probe` — poll an HTTP endpoint first; only dispatch when it reports
    pending work, deduped (same pending set isn't re-fired until it drains;
    drain is inferred when the probe returns 0). Probe config:
    `{ url, method?, headers?, pendingPath, idsPath? }` (`pendingPath` = dot-path
    to the pending array/number; `idsPath` = stable id list for dedup).
  - `command` is delivered as an **intercom turn** to the running session — act
    on it as a binding directive (run the `/skill`/command immediately).
  - `offSessionPolicy`: `auto_launch` (buddy opens an **interactive** Max
    session — `$0`, NEVER headless `claude -p` — requires `spawnCwd`) or `wait`.
- **`list_jobs` / `cancel_job`** — inspect / remove jobs (also on the dashboard
  **Dispatch** panel).
- **`pause_all({on, reason?, until?})`** — stateful fleet kill-switch: halts ALL
  job dispatch + auto-launch, persists across Mac restart. Prefer over
  `broadcast_all` for pausing. Resume with `{on:false}`.

**$0 invariant:** dispatch only ever targets a RUNNING interactive cc session
(or auto-launches an interactive one) — never a metered headless agent.
